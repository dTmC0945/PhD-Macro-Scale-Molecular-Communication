# PhD-Macro-Scale-Molecular-Communication

Hi Everyone.

This is a collection of my programs I used during my PhD on Macro-Scale Molecular Communications.

The topic is about modelling the transmission of chemical signals as it propagates through space.

Feel free to use the code as you wish. I have also added the data I gathered from experiments as a starting point.

My Thesis is included in my LinkedIn profile <href> https://www.linkedin.com/in/dtmcguiness/ </href>
